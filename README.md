# merges the two halves of data into one sorted data.

This code is designed to efficiently bring together two separate halves of data.
It carefully processes each portion to ensure no information is lost.
By comparing values step by step, it maintains the correct order throughout the merge.
The logic ensures that the final output is both accurate and well-structured.
Two independent data segments are transformed into one unified dataset.
Sorting is preserved automatically during the merging process.
This approach improves performance and reduces unnecessary computations.
The result is a clean, organized, and reliable data structure.
It eliminates duplication while maintaining data integrity.
Overall, the code delivers a seamless and efficient data-merging solution.
